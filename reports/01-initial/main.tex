\section{Introduction}

We decided to name the team \textbf{Peer2Whisper}, like the peers are whispering to each other to spread information in the network. The team members are Fabio Gaiba and Lukas Heindl.

\Todo{Does the team name sound cool?}

\Todo{They mention "which implementation" we chose, what's that? Gossip or somehting else?}


\section{First Decisions}
\subsection{Ecosystem}
\subsubsection{Language}

We opted to use Golang to develop the module for multiple reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The language has good native support for asynchronous programming 
	\item It comes with a good set of developing tools (packet manager, code formatter/linter)
	\item It is statically typed  
	\item Lukas has good experience with it and Fabio is interested in learning it.
	\item It's what the \enquote{cool kids (xD)} use
\end{enumerate}

\Todo{Check if correct (I think I can use bullet points this way)}

\subsubsection{OS}
% TODO Fabio/Lukas

We use Linux as it is the easier choice for developing (almost) any software. Moreover we find the UNIX philosophy very intuitive and we are fond of the free software principles in general. We believe that the open source nature of the Linux kernel makes it a more secure, reliable and efficient alternative than any proprietary OS.

He wanted to experiment with the declarative definition of the system, particularly in setting up a customized desktop environment in an easy-to-reproduce manner, and with the separation of developing packages from system packages. He is still very new to Nix's principles.

Lukas' Distro:

\Todo{Check (and adjust) the common statement about Linux}

\subsubsection{Build-system}
% TODO Lukas
\begin{itemize}
	\item golang includes the tool-chain, including how to build and dependency management
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quality of software}
% TODO Fabio

Golang offers a built support for unit testing. To test \verb|example.go| it will be sufficient to write the unit test in \verb|example\_test.go| and then run \verb|go test| to run all unit tests. As far as how will those unit test be written, we want to take a simple approach with \textit{Black Box Testing} (so just looking at the input/output pairs) and use the \textit{AAA} pattern (Arrange, Act and Assert).

To ensure Code Quality, we will use built in go tools as \verb|go fmt| for formatting and \verb|go vet| as a static code checker. We will also take advantage of slightly more powerful static checker as \href{https://staticcheck.dev/}{staticcheck} and \href{https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint}{golangci-lint}.

We also think it would be interesting to look into git hooks to perform automatic local testing before pushing (or merging to main).

\Todo{check git hooks part}

\subsubsection{Libraries}
% TODO Lukas
\begin{itemize}
	\item stdlib for stuff like \href{https://pkg.go.dev/log}{log}/\href{https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@go1.22.2}{slog}, \href{https://pkg.go.dev/net}{networking} (tcp/udp) and \href{https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rand}{randomness} \Todo{\href{crypto/sha256}{hashing}} % \href{https://github.com/google/uuid}{UUID} maybe as well
	\item \href{github.com/lmittmann/tint}{tint} for nicer logging
	\item ini parsing like \href{gopkg.in/ini.v1}{ini}
	\item argument parser? -- like \href{https://github.com/alexflint/go-arg}{go-arg}
	\item \Todo{think about stuff like protobuf}
\end{itemize}

\section{Legal matters}
% TODO Fabio

\Todo{I don't know if we should cite. If yes, do you know if can use BibiTex?}

We chose to use a GPLv3 license.
We use quite a lot of free software and appreciate a lot the open source community. We believe that software should be distributed with the right of using it as you want and modify it as you want. Moreover, we don't want free software to be used to produce proprietary software. A copyleft license is the best fit for our project, not necessarily because we anticipate real-world usage of it, but as a matter of principle.

\section{Previous experience}
% TODO Fabio/Lukas

Fabio has participated in the QUIC project for the Advanced Computer Network course, using Golang as the primary language. The project, while not extensive, involved implementing both a client and a server using the QUIC library developed in Go, as well as utilizing examples from the library. Additionally, he made several contributions to a \href{https://github.com/csunibo/polleg}{Go web server for a student project}.

Lukas:

\Todo{We both did QUIC project, we could merge that}

\section{Workload distribution}
% TODO Fabio

The goal is to achieve an equal distribution of the workload between the two students. We take into account that Lukas is far more proficient in Golang, especially when it comes to using and interacting with libraries. Hence, we expect Fabio to write fewer lines of code within the same amount of time. Moreover, we anticipate Lukas being involved in peer programming sessions where he will assist Fabio, so his workload might be larger than what is visible. To balance this, Fabio will take on a larger role in report writing and in studying and designing the protocol. It's important to emphasize that this is just a forecast, and the actual workload distribution may be quite different in the end.

\Todo{Check if this makes sense and if we could/should go more into technical details}
