\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fabio Gaiba
	\item Lukas Heindl
	\item Gossip
	\item \Todo{team name}
\end{itemize}

\section{First Decisions}
\subsection{Ecosystem}
\subsubsection{Language}
\begin{itemize}
	\item golang
	\item works well with async
	\item easy to develop with
	\item it's what the \enquote{cool kids (xD)} use
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{OS}
% TODO Fabio/Lukas

Fabio:

Lukas:


\begin{itemize}
	\item Linux, Arch and NixOS
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Build-system}
% TODO Lukas
\begin{itemize}
	\item golang includes the tool-chain, including how to build and dependency management
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quality of software}
% TODO Fabio


\begin{itemize}
	\item write unit tests for functions
	\item golang also includes (checking the) format(ting)
	\item \Todo{familarize with code quality checking in golang}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Libraries}
% TODO Lukas
\begin{itemize}
	\item stdlib for stuff like \href{https://pkg.go.dev/log}{log}/\href{https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@go1.22.2}{slog}, \href{https://pkg.go.dev/net}{networking} (tcp/udp) and \href{https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rand}{randomness} \Todo{\href{crypto/sha256}{hashing}} % \href{https://github.com/google/uuid}{UUID} maybe as well
	\item \href{github.com/lmittmann/tint}{tint} for nicer logging
	\item ini parsing like \href{gopkg.in/ini.v1}{ini}
	\item argument parser? -- like \href{https://github.com/alexflint/go-arg}{go-arg}
	\item \Todo{think about stuff like protobuf}
\end{itemize}

\section{Legal matters}
% TODO Fabio

\Todo{I don't know if we should cite. If yes, do you know if can use BibiTex?}

We chose to use a GPLv3 license.
We use quite a lot of free software and appreciate a lot the open source community. We believe that software should be distributed with the right of using it as you want and modify it as you want. Moreover, we don't want free software to be used to produce proprietary software. A copyleft license is the best fit for our project, not necessarily because we anticipate real-world usage of it, but as a matter of principle.

\section{Previous experience}
% TODO Fabio/Lukas

Fabio has participated in the QUIC project for the Advanced Computer Network course, using Golang as the primary language. The project, while not extensive, involved implementing both a client and a server using the QUIC library developed in Go, as well as utilizing examples from the library. Additionally, he made several contributions to a \href{https://github.com/csunibo/polleg}{Go web server for a student project}.

Lukas:

\Todo{We both did QUIC project, we could merge that}

\section{Workload distribution}
% TODO Fabio

The goal is to achieve an equal distribution of the workload between the two students. We take into account that Lukas is far more proficient in Golang, especially when it comes to using and interacting with libraries. Hence, we expect Fabio to write fewer lines of code within the same amount of time. Moreover, we anticipate Lukas being involved in peer programming sessions where he will assist Fabio, so his workload might be larger than what is visible. To balance this, Fabio will take on a larger role in report writing and in studying and designing the protocol. It's important to emphasize that this is just a forecast, and the actual workload distribution may be quite different in the end.

\Todo{Check if this makes sense and if we could/should go more into technical details}
