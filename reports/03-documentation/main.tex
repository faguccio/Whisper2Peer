\section{Introduction}
In this document we will introduce the overall design of our module \textbf{Whisper2Peer}.
We will first quickly describe how our application is build, tested and run.
Then we will show the module architecture from a logical standpoint and the different threads used in the process.
Since we are using golang, our threads are actually goroutines.
Note that for simplicity we are using the both terms \emph{goroutine} and \emph{thread} interchangeable.
We will give sample scenarios to understand how messages are processed and travel the program.
We will also show our own abstractions over the networking layer.

% TODO(pull) change needed if pull is implemented
After that, we will cover the concrete gossip strategy we implemented including the different parameters used by the strategy.
Later we will discuss the security measure we implemented, as well as the peer-to-peer protocol we put in place.
Finally, we will explore what next steps would make sense when continuing to work on this project and how the workload was distributed between the team members.

\section{How to run/build}
The application is written in golang.
Therefore the tools provided by golang can (and should) be used to build and test the application.
You will find more information on this aspect in our \texttt{README.md}\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.lrz.de/netintum/teaching/p2psec_projects_2024/Gossip-3/-/blob/main/gossip/README.md}}.
\Todo{does this automatically install the dependencies?}

If you need\,/\,want a more technical documentation for every function\,/\,struct defined, you can make use of the documentation generated by the \texttt{godoc} tool\footnote{\url{https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc}}. For this run \lstinline{godoc -http=:6060} in the \texttt{gossip/} folder and navigate to \url{http://localhost:6060/pkg/gossip/} in the Web-Browser.

\section{Module Architecture}

We decided to divide the project into four main packages. Those main packages are described in \cref{fig:overview}. The following is just a brief overview, each part will be discussed in more detail in the following subsections.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Gossip}: is in charge of managing the whole module. It has to take and use the configuration parameters, orchestrate the other components and filter and relay messages. Moreover, in this package we define the data structure that holds in memory the registered \textit{Gossip Types}.
	\item \textbf{Vertical API}: its main goal is to manage connection to other modules. It provides an abstraction over the networking part and manages under the hood the marshaling and un-marshaling of the messages.
	\item \textbf{Horizontal API}: is very similar to the \texttt{Vertical API}, except it has to communicate with the peer's Gossip modules.
	\item \textbf{Gossip-Strategy}: this package is in charge of instantiating a concrete strategy for disseminating the information between peers. It leverages the \texttt{Horizontal API} to communicate with peers, focusing just on how to handle the messages.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these four main packages, there are also a \textbf{Common} package, holding common data types, an internal \textbf{Ringbuffer} package, defining a circular queue data structure used to store data to be spread in the network and a \textbf{PoW} package implementing (parallelized) solving of proof-of-work challenges.

Those modules create threads which communicate with message passing, as can be seen again in \cref{fig:overview}. This design decision allows the program to be highly scalable due to the degree of parallelization.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Logical structure}
Using UML class diagrams is the standard way of modeling the logical structure of a project (at least with object orientation).
It quickly shows how classes are connected\,/\,coupled to each other and what data a class stores.

The UML class diagram for the packages of our project can be seen in \cref{fig:classDia}.
The \PumlCircle{Struct}{S} marks a struct/class, the \PumlCircle{Interface}{I} marks interfaces and the orange \PumlCircle{Type}{T} marks a type.
Types (as marked with \PumlCircle{Type}{T}) usually are simple type aliases for an existing class (or a built-in type of golang).
Note that for a better overview, this diagram is mostly structured like \cref{fig:overview} with the vertical API on the left and the horizontal API on the right.
Also the diagram is already complex enough with just the classes for the application itself.
Thus, we refrained from also adding some classes solely used for (end-to-end) testing (and benchmarking).
For more information on that part of our project please refer to \cref{sec:testing}.

In our case most of the communication is not done by function calls but by message passing.
Thus, there are fewer functions defined on our classes than one might expect, and the present ones are more general like \lstinline{Listen} or \lstinline{Run}.
To gain a deeper understanding about the internal communication please refer to \cref{sec:msgpassing}.
Still, getting a rough overview of what class implements which interface is also useful for the message passing. \label{sumtypes}
For message passing we need to focus on the interfaces starting with \texttt{To*} and \texttt{From*}.
As sum-types\,/\,unions are not natively supported by golang, our workaround is to send objects implementing the respective interface on each channel.
When receiving on such a channel, we can safely \texttt{switch} over the object's type and handle the respective message.
We use the tool \emph{go-sumtype}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/BurntSushi/go-sumtype}} to check if the \texttt{switch} statements really handle all cases needed (actually this only works in a specific scenario but for more on this refer to the documentation of that tool).

In \cref{sec:structureNetworking} we will go more into detail regarding the networking part.
For now, it is only important that while we implement de- and serialization on the vertical API ourselves, we use capnproto\footnote{\url{https://github.com/capnproto/go-capnp}} on the horizontal API for this task.
The respective logic in both cases is contained in the respective \texttt{types} subpackage.
Since the capnproto code is generated automatically (and contains some capnproto internals), we omit the \texttt{horizontalAPI/types} package while including the \texttt{verticalAPI/types} package in the diagram.

Also note that golang does not have the concept of constructors for a class.
Therefore, data needed\,/\,used for initialization of the classes is not visible in the class diagram.
In most cases the constructor is pretty straight forward.
The \texttt{strategy} package is an exception to this.
Here there is only one generic constructor \texttt{New} which returns an object which implements the \texttt{StrategyCloser} interface (at the moment this is only the \texttt{dummyStrat}).
Which strategy is to be used is decided by the generic constructor based on the arguments.

One additional special case might be the \texttt{common} package.
First this was contained in the \texttt{verticalAPI/types} package but as we progressed, we figured it would be a good idea to extract the definition of some message types we use throughout the whole module.
This way we avoid the necessity to include the \texttt{verticalAPI/types} package everywhere.
During further development a few additional definitions were added to this package with the same reasoning.

Also a bit confusing on first sight might be the \texttt{internal/packetcounter} package.
This is used to collect some statistics and is used for (end-to-end) testing (and benchmarking).

Note: The way we split the application into modules you can also think of the modules (shown in \cref{fig:overview}) as layers.
In this view, the layers from bottom up would be \texttt{horizontalAPI}, \texttt{strategy}, \texttt{gossip}, \texttt{verticalAPI}.

\end{landscape}

\subsection{Process architecture} \label{sec:msgpassing}

To explain the current process architecture, we opted to first give a general overview of how the processes are spawned and supposed to communicate through channels. Secondly, we will display a few scenarios to show how the threads communicate with each other.

\subsubsection{Processes (threads) Creation} \label{process-creation}

\texttt{Gossip} is the entry point of the whole module. This thread spawns a listener \texttt{Vertical API} thread that keeps accepting new connection to the module from other modules following the specification of the problem statement. For each new connection, two new routines are spawned: one that receives and processes messages and one that sends messages. Communication directed to or from routines created by \texttt{Vertical API} happens respectively with channels of the \texttt{ToVert} and \texttt{FromVert} types.

Then, \texttt{Gossip} creates the \texttt{Strategy} thread, which then spawns a listener thread for the \texttt{Horizontal API}. The latter, similarly to the \texttt{Vertical API}, accepts new connection and creates for each one two threads, one for reading and one for writing. Communication between \texttt{Gossip} and \texttt{Strategy} routines happens via the \texttt{FromStrat} and \texttt{ToStrat} channels, while \texttt{Strategy} communicates with threads of \texttt{Horizontal API} via the \texttt{FromHz} and \texttt{ToHz} channels.

As already mentioned, there is actually no communication between \texttt{Horizontal API} goroutines and the \texttt{Gossip}. The channels used for communication can be seen on the arrows in \cref{fig:overview}. It is important to note that there will actually be multiple channels directed to the \textit{Vertical API} (\texttt{ToVert}), as well as multiple channels directed to the \textit{Horizontal API} (\texttt{ToHz}). This is because incoming messages from the network are aggregated on the same channel while outgoing messages are sent to specific hosts, so different channels.


\subsubsection{Scenario 1: Gossip Notify Message}

The first scenario we want to display is the reception of a Gossip Notify message. For the sake of clarity, a single Vertical API thread is used to show both the writing and reading threads.

In this case the message passing is trivial (see \cref{fig:msg-notify}). The Vertical API (\texttt{vertAPI}) receives the \textit{Gossip Notify} message (\texttt{notify}), marshals it and sends it to the main (\texttt{main}) thread where the Gossip Type is registered. It is interesting to note that what we store is the writing communication channel. As previously mentioned in \cref{process-creation}, there are multiple writing channels, one for each host. This greatly simplifies the sending procedure.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/msgpass-notify}
	\caption{Message passing when a Gossip Notify message is received}
	\label{fig:msg-notify}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scenario 2: Gossip Announce Message}

In this scenario, a Gossip Announce message is sent to the Vertical API (\texttt{vertAPI}) thread. This message (\texttt{ann}) goes to the Main (\texttt{main}) module which verifies that the type is registered and if so forwards the message to the Strategy (\texttt{strat}). The strategy then sends the message to the Horizontal API (\texttt{hzAPI}) which takes care of actually sending the message to other peers. In the form of a \textit{PUSH} message. 

The delay in the Strategy, from reception to sending, is due to the implementation. Messages are sent in rounds, so they need to wait until a new sending round starts.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/msgpass-announce}
	\caption{Gossip Announce message is received}
	\label{fig:msg-announce}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Scenario 3: Peer Relayed a Message}

In this last scenario, we depict the handling of a peer \textit{PUSH} message \cref{fig:msg-relay}. First, the message is received by the Horizontal API (\texttt{hzAPI}), then it goes to the concrete Strategy (\texttt{strat}). The strategy processes the message accordingly and asks main (\texttt{main}) to perform a Gossip Notification for such message (\texttt{notific}). If such Gossip Type is registered, Main instructs the Vertical API (\texttt{vertAPI}) to send to connected modules such message (\texttt{notific}). After that, the Vertical API receives a Gossip Validation message (\texttt{val}). On reception, this message travels the threads back to the strategy, which if the message is valid begins to spread it itself. In the figure this is the \textit{PUSH} message marked in gray. If the original message was not deemed valid, the message is not spread further.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/msgpass-relay}
	\caption{Peer receive \textit{PUSH} message}
	\label{fig:msg-relay}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Networking} \label{sec:structureNetworking}
For the networking, first we need to differentiate between the two APIs our module has.
First, the vertical API and second the horizontal API.

\subsubsection{vertical API}
On the vertical API we communicate with other modules typically running on the same peer.
At this point, these modules are implemented by someone else (\eg another team from the lecture).
Therefore, we were handed a specification which defines the format of the messages on that API.
With the hard requirement to adhere to this specification it is not possible for us to use capnproto at this point, so we need to implement the de-\,/\,parsing on our own.
If you have a look back at the class diagram in \cref{fig:classDia} again, this is implemented in the \texttt{verticalAPI/types} package.

\subsubsection{horizontal API}
On the other side we have the horizontal API which is only used for our module to communicate with the same module running on another peer.
As a result, we are completely free to come up with a custom message format on this API.
For reference on the types used, please refer to \cref{sec:msgtypes}.
In our case we decided to use capnproto as a library which does the de-\,/\,parsing for us.
Analog to the vertical API, the code generated by capnproto is placed in the \texttt{horizontalAPI/types} package.

\subsubsection{both API-modules}
Apart from the difference in the message formats and the de-\,/\,parsing both, the horizontal API and the vertical API, modules are quite similar.
Both modules use two threads, one for reading from and one for writing to the socket, per connection in addition to the one thread used to establish (and dispatch) new connections.
Thereby, they both provide a layer of abstraction on top of the raw TCP sockets where other threads can simply send a message on the respective golang channel and (try to) receive from the golang channel in the other direction.

Especially for reading having the golang channel is nice since we can make use of golang's built-in \texttt{select} statement when waiting for messages on multiple sockets.
For writing this approach is not strictly necessary.
Still having a dedicated thread and the golang channel for communication allows us to send the message to the API-module and continue execution without waiting until the message actually was sent on the network connection.

In general this architecture also allows us to have multiple listening (read) and multiple writing threads connected to the API-module.
Since we did not need it so far, we did not implement having multiple listening threads.
Also note how this use of one thread per read\,/\,write on the connection combined with the communication via golang channels implicitly synchronizes the write operations (although in golang this is not strictly necessary to be done manually).


\section{Gossip Strategies}
\Todo{text here how to instanciate different ones and what the idea here is (also with the main/root strategy as kind of library)}
\Todo{3 caches (of size cache size messages) and state machine should be a common scheme}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/fsm_msgs}
	\caption{Finite state machine for message caching.}
	\label{fig:fsm_msgs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Push Strategy}
The push strategy is straight forward.
Every peer pushes new updates to a random subset of its neighbors.

\begin{minipage}{0.50\linewidth}
	\begin{lstlisting}[
		language=pseudo,
		morekeywords={[3]{main,hz}},
		morekeywords={[4]{msg,degree,cache\_size}},
		caption={Pseudo code of the push gossip strategy}
	]
		on push from hz(msg):
			if msg is new (unseen) (not in any of the three caches):
				emit a notification to the main module
				mark msg as invalid for now

		on announce from main(msg):
			append msg to valid messages

		on validation from main(msg):
			if ttl == 1:
				move msg from invalid messages to sent messages
			else:
				move msg from invalid messages to valid messages

		on gossip round():
			S = random subset of the neighbors of size degree
			send all valid messages to S
			if a message was sent more than degree times:
				move msg from valid to sent messages
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\section{Security Measures} \label{sec:security}
\Todo{will eventually be outdated}
\Todo{describe how PoW works (what fields are included) -- also how to adjust and make the challenge harder -- also parallelization}
\Todo{go into detail why/how we use ChaCha to come up with a challenge in a \enquote{smart} way}

Currently, as a node starts, it already has a list of the peer node to connect to. A peer accepts any new connection, which makes the system vulnerable to \textit{Sybil Attacks} and consequently \textit{Eclipse Attacks}. We plan to mitigate this problem by introducing an Identity Validation system based on a computational Proof of Work (PoW).

\subsection{Identity Validation}

When a peer is asked to accept a new connection, it sends a challenge (random nonce) $r$. Based on $r$ and a variable local part $v$, the other peer computes a hash which should start with $n$ leading zeros, much like in the registration challenge for the project. $n$ can be a configuration parameter, meaning that nodes could choose how strong they want proof of work from newly connected nodes (and how strong PoWs are they willing to compute when trying to connect to a peer).

This mitigates Sybil Attacks, since the attacker, in order to create multiple identities, has to perform multiple Proofs of Work. But the attacker can still share its resources by sequentially adding nodes. To counteract this possibility, the idea is to request PoW periodically. 

\subsection{Periodical Proofs of Work}

A node periodically asks the neighboring peers for a PoW. At the same time the node will be prompted by each of its neighbors for PoWs. This way, an attacker would have to compute such PoWs for each fake identity periodically. This limits the amount of Sybils an attacker can keep online in the network with limited resources.

Currently, the idea needs to be further explored, but multiple requests for PoW could be aggregated into a single PoW so that a node does not waste too many resources into multiple PoW. Still an attacker would need to compute one PoW for each fake identity. PoWs could also be preemptively asked to facilitate even more this aggregation (since there is no global synchronization) and also mitigate DoS of peers by flooding it with PoW requests. For the same reason peers should also limit the frequency a neighboring peer is allowed to send a PoW request.


\section{Specification of the peer-to-peer protocol} \label{sec:msgtypes}
This module works with two protocols, one on the vertical API and one on the horizontal API.
The one for the vertical API was already predetermined, its specification can be found in the \emph{specification.pdf} document (see moodle\footnote{\url{https://www.moodle.tum.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=3090766}}).
For the other one we had the freedom to develop something on our own.
To avoid having to write the de-\,/\,parsing ourselves, we chose to use capnproto.
Capnproto is a data serialization format which comes with libraries in multiple different languages and a respective code generator for those languages.
With capnproto you only specify what data (\enquote{name} and type) should be in the message.
The concrete message format is then the concern of capnproto.

With this in mind, it makes no real sense to include the concrete format of the messages but only the names of the fields and their type.
% TODO(pull)
As of now er have seven message types on the horizontal API.
The most important one is the \emph{Push} message type as it is actually used to spread information in the network.
Its fields and types can be seen in \cref{tab:push}.

The six remaining message types can be split into two groups. One with the \emph{Conn} prefix and one with the \emph{Pow} prefix.
Both groups are of size three.
Regarding the payload, both sets of message types are equal.
We used different message types nonetheless since we use them in a slightly different context and want to be able to differentiate what message exactly was sent.
Both sets of message types consist of
a \emph{Req} message type (see \cref{tab:req}),
a \emph{Chall} message type (see \cref{tab:chall}) and
a \emph{Pow} message type (see \cref{tab:pow}).
All of them are used for our security mechanism.
For more information on this mechanism please refer to \cref{sec:security}.

The actual message sent on the horizontal API is not a raw instance of the a message described above but a more generic message type which is a simple union of all message types that can be sent on the horizontal API.
This approach makes is possible to add more message types as we go by simply adding more types to this union.
The nice thing at this point is that capnproto handles the complete checking which message type was actually sent (resolving the union so to speak).
This way we do not need to come up with \eg a messageType field on our own and allocate identifiers for the individual types.

\section{Testing} \label{sec:testing}
\Todo{Lukas: benchmarking + testing, explain how the tester works}

\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future}
\Todo{outdated!!}
\Todo{pull strategy?}
\Todo{benchmaring (stubs are present)?}
We already built a decent architecture which allows us to easily add new components or replace existing ones.
We plan on adding at least a pull strategy, whether we still have time for a push-pull strategy remains unclear.

Additionally, we plan to also add some end-to-end tests on a simple network for which we can determine which peers should receive the message being spread.
Having an infrastructure for this end-to-end testing should also make it possible to do some sort of benchmarking with much larger networks.
For this we plan on generate some networks in advance (using the models presented in the lecture which are implemented in the python library networkx\footnote{\url{https://networkx.org/}}).
We can then use these predefined networks to setup the peers and spread one (or multiple) messages in the network.
Based on the logging we can then evaluate which peer received which message at what point in time.
Here it comes to our advantage that everything runs on the same host which implies the clocks are perfectly in sync.
This benchmarking approach should allow us to perform some comparisons at least with different parameters, or if we implemented an additional strategy also compare the different strategies.

For now we do not have the security mesaures presented in \cref{sec:security} in place.
We plan to implement at least the discussed proof-of-work based security measure until the end of the project.

\section{Workload distribution}
As already outlined, we split our module in various different packages.
This enabled us to distribute the packages and work independently of each other (apart from defining the communication\,/\,interface of course).

Fabio focused on the developing the Strategy package, which was greatly written in peer programming, especially in the beginning when defining the whole interface. He also wrote the tests for the vertical API and developed the most part of the PoW security mechanism.

Lukas worked on the horizontal API and the vertical API (from which the common package later was derived).
Note that at least writing the de-\,/\,parsing of the vertical API was pretty straight forward because it is fairly similar to what we needed to do for the registration client.
He also wrote the module which is used to solve the PoW challenge (in parallel) and developed the capabilities for easy end-to-end testing (and the stubs for benchmarking).

While Fabio started working on the main package, Lukas later did some refactoring and finalized the package.

\section{Effort spent for the project}
Both of us did not strictly measure the time spent on the project. We report here a rough estimation on weekly hours spent working on the project, since the creation and submission of the initial report.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fabio: 8-9 hours a week
	\item Lukas: 9-10 hours a week
\end{itemize}

We would also like to stress that this estimation is an average.
There were weeks where one member did slightly less and weeks when he did more.
Moreover, it is not the case that those hours were spread equally across the week, but rather done in 3-4 hours long session (in a few occasion a bit more).
Also, sometimes these were pair-programming sessions or sessions for planning where the architecture was planned (and almost no code was written).
Especially after the lecture period ended Fabio was able to put more effort into the project while Lukas worked more on the project arround the exam phase.
